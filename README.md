# jaql
JAQL - Just Another Quantum Language. A Lox implementation attempting to be quantum, eventually. 


## TODOS:

    1. My error reporting implementation kind of sucks, need to overhaul + fix. Should only be raising errors and catching where appropriate, that prevents this bad passing round of a Jaql obj.
    2. Line counting is wrong
    3. floats are broken: Expect property name after '.'.
